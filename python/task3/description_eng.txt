Write a prototype of a test system consisting of two test cases. In this task
using a third-party module for test automation is discouraged.
A test system is a class hierarchy that describes test cases.
Each test case has:
Number (tc_id) and name (name)
Methods for preparing (prep), executing (run), and completing (clean_up) tests.
The execute method, which sets the general order of the test case execution and
handles exceptions.
All stages of the test case execution, as well as exceptional situations, should be
documented in the log file or standard output.

Test case 1: List of files
[prep] If the current system time, specified as an integer number of seconds from
the beginning of the Unix era, not a multiple of two, then it is necessary to interrupt the test case execution.
[run] List files from the current user's home directory.
[clean_up] No action required.

Test case 2: Random file
[prep] If the amount of RAM of the machine on which the test is executed is
less than one gigabyte, then it is necessary to interrupt the test case execution.
[run] Create a 1024 KB file test with random content.
[clean_up] Delete file test.
