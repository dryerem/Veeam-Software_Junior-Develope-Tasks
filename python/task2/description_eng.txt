Given a file containing filenames, a hashing algorithm (one of MD5 / SHA1 / SHA256) and
the corresponding hash sums calculated by the corresponding algorithm and indicated in
file separated by a space. Write a program that reads the given file and checks
integrity of files.
Example

Sums file:
file_01.bin md5 aaeab83fcc93cd3ab003fa8bfd8d8906
file_02.bin md5 6dc2d05c8374293fe20bc4c22c236e2e
file_03.bin md5 6dc2d05c8374293fe20bc4c22c236e2e
file_04.txt sha1 da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709

Call example:
<your program> <path to the input file> <path to the directory containing
the files to check>

Output format:
file_01.bin OK
file_02.bin FAIL
file_03.bin NOT FOUND
file_04.txt OK
